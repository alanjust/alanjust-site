        <p class="main-text"><span class="art-color">Art</span> and <span class="design-color">design</span> are both creative fields that involve visual expression and aesthetics. However, there are significant differences between the two:</p>

        <ol class="main-text" style="padding-left:2em;">
          <li style="padding-bottom:16px;font-size:26px;line-height:2.8rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.7);">
            <strong style="color:#fff;">Purpose</strong>: The primary purpose of <span class="art-color">art</span> is to express ideas, emotions, or feelings. <span class="art-color">Art</span> is created to evoke a response or reaction from the viewer, and it often has a subjective or personal meaning. On the other hand, the primary purpose of <span class="design-color">design</span> is to solve a specific problem or meet a specific need. <span class="design-color">Design</span> is created to be functional, efficient, and effective in achieving a particular goal.
          </li>
          <li style="padding-bottom:16px;font-size:26px;line-height:2.8rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.7);">
            <strong style="color:#fff;">Process</strong>: <span class="art-color">Artistic</span> creation is often driven by intuition, personal expression, and experimentation. The <span class="art-color">artist</span> may have a general idea of what they want to create, but the final product is often shaped by the <span class="art-color">artist's</span> emotions, thoughts, and experiences. In contrast, <span class="design-color">design</span> is a more structured and systematic process that involves research, planning, and problem-solving. The <span class="design-color">designer</span> works to understand the needs of the audience, define the problem, and then develop solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
          </li>
          <li style="padding-bottom:16px;font-size:26px;line-height:2.8rem;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.7);">
            <strong style="color:#fff;">Outcome</strong>: <span class="art-color">Art</span> is often created for its own sake, and the outcome can be open to interpretation. The viewer may derive their own meaning from the <span class="art-color">work</span>, and there may be multiple valid interpretations. In contrast, <span class="design-color">design</span> has a specific outcome in mind, such as a <span class="design-color">product</span>, a <span class="design-color">logo</span>, or a <span class="design-color">website</span>. Or, to <span class="design-color">persuade</span>. The success of the <span class="design-color">design</span> is measured by how well it meets the intended goal or solves the intended problem.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="main-text">In summary, while <span class="art-color">art</span> and <span class="design-color">design</span> share some similarities, they have different purposes, processes, and outcomes. <span class="art-color">Art is subjective and expressive</span>, while <span class="design-color">design is more objective and functional</span>.</p>
