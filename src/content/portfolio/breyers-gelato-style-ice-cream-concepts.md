<p id="">I used to work at a large Midwest agency where I was assigned to manage the Breyer's Ice Cream account. My primary responsibility was to design seasonal flavor carton graphics for the brand. </p><p id="">However, what I found most enjoyable was exploring their various "concept" offerings and visualizing how they would look on the shelves. It was a great opportunity to flex my creative muscles and come up with unique and eye-catching designs.</p><p id="">Restaurants and specialty shops in larger, up-scale U.S. markets were serving the Italian–style ice cream, gelato, to an enthusiastic and rapidly growing market. I developed several soft-serve style ice cream design prototypes that leveraged Breyer's position as leader in the "All Natural" indulgent food category.</p><p>‍</p>
