<p id="">Lone Star was a dying brand, and the goal of this redesign was to reverse that trend. The challenge was that the existing label was much loved, even by people who didn’t consume the beverage. In addition, it’s an icon of the state of Texas, and its citizens are very proud of it. I had to create a new look that wouldn’t alienate current consumers but that would also draw in new drinkers.</p><p id="">Success. Sales increased 60% in the first full year after the new look was released due to increased retail support and stronger on-shelf presence.</p><p id=""><em id="">Effective—</em></p><p id="">Increased net sales</p><p id="">Additional demographic</p><p id=""><em id="">Efficient—</em></p><p id="">Direct design lead</p><p id="">Direct communication</p><p id="">On time</p><p id="">On budget</p><p id="">13 SKUs</p><p id="">8 weeks</p><p id="">‍</p>
