<p id="">Anvil is a vanity wine priced at $40-$50 to showcase the skills and talent of Forgeron Cellar's winemaker, Marie-Eve Gilla.</p><p id="">What is unique about the illustration is its modernization of a traditional 19th-century steel cut engraving style.</p><p id="">My approach to design is to make the design sturdy, resistant to the rigors and inconsistencies of production. I like to use foil, hot stamping and embossing as well as most designers. I make sure the success of the design will survive their absence. </p><p>‍</p>
